# Book Recommendation System

## Overview

The Book Recommendation System is a machine learning project aimed at enhancing the book discovery experience for users. Leveraging unsupervised learning techniques and the Book-Crossing dataset, we've developed various recommendation models.

## Project Structure

- **Code:** Delve into the Jupyter notebook used for data analysis, exploration model development.
- **Dataset:** Access the Book-Crossing dataset used for our recommendation models.
- **Slides:** Explore our project journey through presentation slides. From data preprocessing to evaluation, each slide provides a snapshot of our approach.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Rigorous cleaning and refining of the dataset to ensure integrity and coherence.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth exploration of user demographics, book metadata, and rating distributions.
- **Recommendation Models:** Implementation of both low-risk, reliable models and high-risk, innovative approaches.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluation using surveys to gather subjective feedback on model effectiveness.
